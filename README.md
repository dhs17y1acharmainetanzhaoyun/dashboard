# Dashboard [![GitHub version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/bblfsh%2Fdashboard.svg)](https://github.com/bblfsh/dashboard/releases) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bblfsh/dashboard.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bblfsh/dashboard)


## Installation

The easiest way to deploy **dashboard** is using *Docker*.

```sh
docker run -p 8080:80 bblfsh/dashboard -bblfsh-addr <bblfsh-server-addr>
```

If you don't have a bblfsh server running you can execute the dashboard and the server using the following command:

```sh
docker run --privileged -d -p 9432:9432 --name bblfsh bblfsh/bblfshd
docker run -p 8080:80 --link bblfsh bblfsh/dashboard -bblfsh-addr bblfsh:9432
```

Please read the [getting started](https://doc.bblf.sh/user/getting-started.html) guide, to learn more about how to use and deploy a bblfsh server, install drivers, etc.

If don't want to run **dashboard** using our *Docker* image you can download a binary from [releases](https://github.com/bblfsh/dashboard/releases) page.

## Development

The dashboard is a Golang application, so in order for all further insturctions to work please make sure it's under `$GOPATH` in your filesystem.

The dashboard uses an intermediate API that connects to the bblfsh server and serves the dashboard front assets.

Every time you change any source of the front assets, it is needed to regenerate the `server/asset/asset.go` containing the static files of the site.

It can be done running
```sh
make assets
```

### Access the dashboard locally

To run it locally you can run:
```sh
make serve
```
(Do it every time you modify something in the sources to re-generate the `server/asset/asset.go` file, the dashboard api, and to serve the updated dashboard itself)

And access the dashboard through http://localhost:9999
